# Parser

Library that helps with parsing. For an example see [aaa](https://github.com/lk16/aaa), which uses this package.


### TODO
- show meaningful location where parsing failed
- forward file names in error messages
- rename `new_parse_generic` to something better
- remove anything from `Tree` without symboltype
